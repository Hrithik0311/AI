                AI can think and learn just like humans. Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is all about teaching computers to act like people. It’s changing how everyone works,lives, and solves problems by making things faster, smarter, and easier. AI is transforming everyone’s world by mimicking human intelligence and helping everyone improve the way everyone lives and works.

        </p>
        <p>First of all, AI affects humans by changing the way humans work and live, making tasks faster, easier, and more productive. AI helps people by handling repetitive tasks and speeding up decisions, allowing them to focus on more creative and important work. It changes how humans work by making things easier and more productive, and it’s improving the way humans use technology to get things done (Coursera). This text explains that AI can learn a lot of things. This answers the  question because it provides information for what is AI? To create AI,  the  first step is to define the problem and set clear goals. Then, organize the data and pick the right technology for the task. After building a solution, test it to see if it works. If it doesn’t, keep experimenting until  the desired result (Coursera). This explains that creating AI involves solving problems, organizing data, and testing solutions. This is relevant because it shows how AI affects humans by making work easier, faster, and more efficient. As AI improves, it helps by completing tasks better and transforms how humans use technology in everyday life. This concludes AI not only makes tasks easier but also transforms how humans solve problems and improve their daily lives.
Secondly, AI, a really big hot topic, can do a lot of services. For example, ​​Al is used in various applications, such as digital assistants, search engines, social media, online shopping, and robots. All of the applications have different functions, some bigger functions are digital assistants they are supposed to do simple tasks and answer any questions. (Workgrid). Another futuristic function is robots. They handle repetitive tasks or anything deemed too dangerous for a human worker, soon enough robots can work with hot lava to make steel rods so that people don’t get hurt while working. (Tableau)These are some popular examples.
Lastly, AI or Artificial Intelligence, is about teaching machines to think and act like people. AI is about teaching machines to think and act like people (University of Cincinnati Online).The text is relevant because it shows AI helps machines do things like humans, making life easier for humans. AI makes things easier by handling repetitive tasks, letting people focus on more creative or important work. It helps speed up decision-making and makes things more personalized. By boosting productivity, it helps businesses grow and develop new ideas. The text shows how AI helps humans by doing repetitive tasks and making decisions faster, so people can focus on creative or important work. This shows  how AI makes work easier, helps humans be more productive, and changes the way humans use technology (University of Cincinnati Online). In short, AI is like a smart assistant that takes care of boring jobs and helps humans focus on what really matters.
	In conclusion, AI is changing the world by thinking and acting like humans.It helps everyone by doing repetitive tasks, speeding up decision-making, and improving how everyone works and lives. It also changes how everyone uses technology to solve problems and become more productive. Just Imagine a class without Miss Lloyd and a robot controlling the class and technology.
